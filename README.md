🩺 Diabetes Prediction App

An advanced Machine Learning-powered web application built with Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health parameters.
The app combines simplicity with accuracy, enabling healthcare professionals, researchers, and individuals to get instant insights into diabetes risk.

✨ Key Highlights

Interactive and user-friendly Streamlit interface

Real-time diabetes risk prediction

Pre-trained ML model integrated with scikit-learn

Clear and intuitive results with ✅ Safe / ⚠️ At Risk indicators

Lightweight, fast, and deployable on multiple platforms

🧠 How It Works

Users provide health details such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, insulin, pregnancies, age, and gender.
The trained ML model processes these inputs and instantly predicts whether the patient is likely to have diabetes.
